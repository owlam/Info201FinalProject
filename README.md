Recent Crime Data in Washington and the United States

This project dives further into the topic of crime rates across the United States and also specifically in the state of Washington. With the tables, graphs, and maps that weâ€™ve constructed, we hope that viewers and users will gain both a more fundamental and in-depth understanding of the number of cases of different kinds of crimes that occur in the United States and in Washington state. In doing so, our users will be able to understanding crime trends in the country and be able to use past data to potentially predict the trends later on.
